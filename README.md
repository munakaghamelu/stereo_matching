# stereo_matching
Uses python libraries numpy, matplotlib, PIL to produce disparity images using stereo matching and graphs to compare quick sort and merge sort algorithms.

matplotlib: a plotting library for the pythong programming language and its numerical mathematics extension numPy, provides OOP API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI. Used for the first section of the coursework, to plot quicksort and merge sort graphs to compare both algorithms and identify general shape to work out the Big O to characterise the algorithms based on the growth of their rates e.g. time/space (considered time).

pil: python imaging library, adds support for opening, manipulating and saving many different image formats. Used to produce the disparity images of the template image files provided. Allows per-pixel manipulations, masking and transparency handling, imagine filtering/blurring/contouring/smoothing, image enhancing and adding text to images.
